This is due to the level of melanin (pigment produced by colour-producing cells) in their skin. The amount of tan depends on the light and exposure. After exposure some people experience immediate darkening - this is due to UVA rays. A delayed tanning can be seen with UVB rays which increases the number and activity of melanin cells. This also increases with multiple exposures. Thus photopretection is important. This delayed tan can stay for many weeks. Using adequate sunscreen and other photoprotective measures can reduce the tanning effect.</div> <div style='margin-bottom:15px'> It can take weeks to rid off a tan.
